# Web Design - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! I used HTML and CSS to create a dashboard



In building this dashboard, I've created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. 
These pages contains the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. Here we have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, 
and another page where we can view the data used to build them.


The website consist of 7 pages total, including:

* A [landing page](#landing-page) containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page](#comparisons-page) that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
    * The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.
* A ["Data" page](#data-page) that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
